These are additional experiments that I did at one point or another. I have not updated them for the current version of the code, so they may not work.

* `cnn_1mer.ipynb`: Hyperparameter optimization for CNN1Mer model
* `twolength.ipynb`: An experiment trying to see if stratifying the SHMoof model into long and short components would help, but it doesn't
* `cnnmlp.ipynb`: Adding a hidden layer in the final layer is bad
* `fivemer.ipynb`: L2 regularizing the 5mer model doesn't help
* `penalize-site-rates.ipynb`: Trying to penalize the site rates of SHMoof
* `multihit-poisson.ipynb`: An attempt to derive a Poisson codon model
